abstract = "The territorial demarcation problem is concerned with articulating the criteria that suitably demarcate between two classes of sentences, those that are empirically significant and those that are not. However, it is not controversial to conclude that philosophical folklore holds that demarcationism is dead. The death of demarcationism, however, has been greatly exaggerated; I show that this obituary was premature by examining the most popular autopsies for demarcationism. I then set out two proposed demarcation criteria and explain why a misidentification of the purpose and aims of these demarcation criteria leads to an unmotivated rejection of both."
