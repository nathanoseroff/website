abstract = "There is no known method that has a higher objective probability of classifying scientific theories as probably approximately true than other methods. Furthermore, appealing to a subjective or epistemic interpretation of the probability calculus relies on fixed priors. However, there is an important distinction between cases where theory and experiment cohere and cases where theory and experiment conflict: scientists can discover error by properly classifying the conjunction of a scientific theory, its auxiliary hypotheses, and an experimental outcome as false. Thus institutions may aim at the elimination of error. This aim may be less optimal than at the aim of probable approximate truth, but the elimination of error may be the only achievable aim. But how to isolate error in a theoretical system, given the Duhem problem? In this talk, I describe what institutional virtues reliably aim towards the elimination of error and what environmental conditions must hold for these institutional virtues to reliably eliminate error."
