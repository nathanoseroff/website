abstract = "I address Wilfrid Sellars' response to one horn of Agrippa's trilemma: a regress of reasons for belief must either lead to an infinite regress, non-inferential basic beliefs, or a vicious circle. Perceptual experiences seem like a plausible candidate as non-inferrential basic beliefs: they are (presumably) non-inferential, immediate in their presentation, and this immediacy of these private sensations makes them *prima facie* undeniable. I address the respective approach taken by Rudolf Carnap and Otto Neurath in setting out how to express perceptual experiences as protocol sentences--a theory-neutral observation language--, then cover Sellars' critique of this programme, and how the critique influenced Richard Rorty, Michael McDowell and Richard Dreyfus."
