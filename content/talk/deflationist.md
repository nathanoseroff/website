abstract = "I address how traditional theories of knowledge must deal with a longstanding problem in philosophy, known as the swamping problem. I cover the version present in Plato's *Meno*--known as the swamping problem--and Linda Zagzebski's secondary value problem. I address Duncan Pritchard attempt at resolving this problem by introducing a final value to knowledge, then introduce a number of intuition pumps for the nonexistence of final value. I then introduce the *extended value problem* and provide a number of intuition pumps that support the conclusion that deflationist theories of knowledge account for all version of the value problem while other theories of knowledge do not."
