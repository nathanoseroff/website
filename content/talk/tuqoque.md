abstract = "Is it irrational or rational to adopt theism? There exists many different proposed theories of rationality. This question raises second-order question: *What standards should be adopted when choosing between conflicting theories of rationality?* We should rationally choose our standards, yet this produces two further questions: *what should count as the rational adoption of some standard*? and *which standards should be rationally adopted*? The first requires a standard of rational adoption; the second requires the rational adoption of standards. This is the traditional problem of the criterion. I focus on three proposed attempts at jointly solving the problem of the criterion and preserving the possibility of the rational adoption of theism: (1) Alvin Plantinga's reformed epistemology, (2) the *tu quoque defence* developed by Karl Barth and Paul Tillich, and (3) comprehensively critical rationalism, a theory of rationality developed by W.W. Bartley. After comparing their respective approaches, I conclude comprehensively critical rationalism provides the most principled approach for both resolving the problem of the criterion and permitting the possibility of the rational adoption of the theistic stance. I then provide historical evidence that there exist versions of the theistic stance that are compatible with comprehensively critical rationalism."
